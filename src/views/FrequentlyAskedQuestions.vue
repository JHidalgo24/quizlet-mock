    <h3>Why I use image URLs instead of uploads</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>The reason is that it costs more money to upload an image than it would to save a url that your phone can load.
      This is what lets the website be free and lets you use images.
      <br>
      <br>
      I encourage you to upload these images to a free image uploading service (IMGUR) and then pasting your URL
      Make sure that you are copying the image address and not the website's address

    <h3>Keep it a secret</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>
      There is a cap to uploads because I am not rich. I use a free database option so the more people hear about the
      app the more it will cost me. As of right now there is no cap. So don't share this app too much
